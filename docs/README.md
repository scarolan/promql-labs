# PromQL Labs Slide Decks

This directory contains the slide decks for the PromQL Labs training course. These slides are designed to accompany the hands-on lab exercises found in the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced directories.

## Structure

The slide decks are organized into modules that correspond to the lab exercises:

- **00_PromQL_Fundamentals**: Introduction to PromQL syntax and basic concepts
- **01_CPU_Exploration**: Exploring CPU metrics with basic PromQL queries
- **02_CPU_Rates**: Understanding and calculating CPU rates
- **03_Memory_Filesystem**: Memory and filesystem metrics analysis
- **04_Network_Load**: Network metrics and traffic analysis
- **05_Advanced_CPU_Anomaly**: Advanced techniques for CPU anomaly detection
- **06_Correlating_Metrics**: Methods for correlating different metrics
- **07_Recording_Rules_Alerting**: Working with recording rules and alerts
- **08_Advanced_PromQL_Operations**: Complex PromQL functions and operations
- **09_Histograms_Quantiles**: Understanding histogram metrics and quantiles
- **Prometheus_Overview**: General overview of Prometheus and its architecture

## Usage

Each slide deck directory contains an `index.html` file that can be opened in a web browser. The main `index.html` in this directory serves as a landing page with links to all slide decks.

### Viewing Locally

To view the slides:
1. Open the main `index.html` file in your browser
2. Navigate to the desired slide deck from the landing page
3. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the slides

### Presentation Mode

The slide decks are built for presentation purposes and include:
- Speaker notes for instructors
- Code examples that correspond to the lab exercises
- Visual explanations of PromQL concepts

## Relationship to Labs

Each slide deck corresponds to a lab markdown file in the repository:
- The slides provide theoretical context and explanations
- The labs offer hands-on, practical exercises
- The slide decks focus on explaining concepts while the labs focus on applying them

## Additional Files

- `common.css`: Shared styles for all slide decks
- `images/`: Directory containing images used in the slide decks

## Contributing

When updating lab content, consider whether corresponding slides need to be updated as well to maintain consistency.
