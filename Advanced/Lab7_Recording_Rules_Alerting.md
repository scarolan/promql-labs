# üö® Lab 7: Recording Rules and Alerting

## Objectives
- Understand Prometheus recording rules
- Create efficient, reusable PromQL queries
- Build effective alerting rules

## Instructions
1. **Understand recording rules:**
   Recording rules let you precompute frequently used or complex queries and save their results.

   Example recording rule file format:
   ```yaml
   groups:
     - name: cpu_rules
       rules:
         - record: instance:node_cpu_usage:percent
           expr: 100 * (1 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m]))))
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** Recording rules are a powerful Prometheus feature that saves complex calculations as new metrics. The example above creates a new metric called `instance:node_cpu_usage:percent` that stores pre-calculated CPU usage percentages. This follows Prometheus naming conventions with colons separating the context (`instance`), metric name (`node_cpu_usage`), and unit (`percent`).

   **Creating Your First Recording Rule:**
   
   Follow these steps on your Ubuntu 22.04 server or Killercoda environment:
   
   1. Create a rules directory if it doesn't exist:
      ```
      mkdir -p /etc/prometheus/rules
      ```
   
   2. Create a file at `/etc/prometheus/rules/cpu_rules.yml` using your text editor of choice (VS Code, etc.).
      
   3. Copy and paste the YAML above into the file and save it.
   
   4. Open the main Prometheus configuration file at `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` with your text editor.
      
  5. Find the `rule_files` section in the main Prometheus configuration file. It should look like this:
    ```yaml
    # Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
    rule_files:
      # - "first_rules.yml"
      # - "second_rules.yml"
    ```

    Remove or comment out the example entries and add your new rule file path:
    ```yaml
    # Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
    rule_files:
      - "/etc/prometheus/rules/*.yml"
    ```
      
   6. Reload Prometheus configuration:
      ```
      curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload
      ```
      
   7. Verify your rule is loaded by visiting Prometheus UI and clicking on "Rules" in the top menu.
   
2. **Test the performance difference:**
   ```
   # Complex query - calculate in real time
   100 * (1 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode="idle"}[5m]))))
   
   # With a recording rule (faster) - assuming rule is set up
   instance:node_cpu_usage:percent{instance="localhost:9100"}
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** The first query calculates CPU usage in real-time, which can be resource-intensive. The second query uses a pre-computed recording rule which makes it much faster and more efficient. The recording rule precomputes this complex expression and stores the result under a new metric name `instance:node_cpu_usage:percent`, reducing load on Prometheus and improving dashboard performance.

3. **Learn alert rule structure and create an alert:**
   ```yaml
   groups:
     - name: example_alerts
       rules:
         - alert: HighCPUUsage
           expr: instance:node_cpu_usage:percent > 80
           for: 5m
           labels:
             severity: warning
           annotations:
             summary: "High CPU usage on {{ $labels.instance }}"
             description: "CPU usage has exceeded 80% for 5 minutes on {{ $labels.instance }}"
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** This alert rule configuration demonstrates Prometheus's alerting capabilities. The `expr` field contains the PromQL condition that triggers the alert. The `for` duration prevents flapping alerts by requiring the condition to be true for a specified period. The `labels` help categorize alerts (useful for routing), while `annotations` provide human-readable information with template variables like `{{ $labels.instance }}` that are replaced with actual values when the alert fires.
   
   **Setting Up Your First Alert Rule:**
   
   1. Create a file at `/etc/prometheus/rules/cpu_alerts.yml` using your text editor of choice.
      
   2. Copy and paste the YAML above into the file and save it.
   
   3. Ensure the alert will use the recording rule we created earlier. If you skipped that step, modify the `expr` to use the direct calculation:
      ```yaml
      expr: 100 * (1 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode="idle"}[5m])))) > 80
      ```
      
   4. Reload Prometheus configuration:
      ```
      curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload
      ```
      
   5. View your alert rules in the Prometheus UI:
      - Navigate to `http://localhost:9090/alerts` in your browser
      - You should see your HighCPUUsage alert listed
   
   6. To test the alert, you can generate CPU load:
      ```
      stress-ng --cpu 4 --timeout 300s
      ```
      This will stress 4 CPU cores for 5 minutes, which should trigger the alert.

4. **Test alert expressions:**
   ```
   # This would trigger your alert when CPU > 80%
   instance:node_cpu_usage:percent{instance="localhost:9100"} > 80
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** This query uses the recording rule metric to check if CPU usage exceeds 80%. The alert expression will return no data when CPU usage is below 80% and will return data points when CPU usage exceeds 80%. The Prometheus alert manager uses the `for: 5m` clause in the alert rule to only trigger an alert if this condition persists for at least 5 minutes, reducing alert noise from brief spikes.

## Challenge
- Create a recording rule expression for memory usage percentage, following Prometheus naming conventions.

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è <b>Show Solution</b></summary>

To create a recording rule for memory usage percentage following Prometheus naming conventions:

1. **Create the recording rule configuration** in your `prometheus.yml` file or a separate rules file:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: memory_rules
    rules:
      - record: instance:node_memory_usage:percent
        expr: 100 * (1 - (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes))
```

The name `instance:node_memory_usage:percent` follows Prometheus naming conventions:
- `instance:` prefix indicates it's an instance-level metric
- `node_memory_usage` describes the metric's purpose
- `:percent` suffix indicates the unit

2. **Create an alert rule that uses this recording rule**:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: memory_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: instance:node_memory_usage:percent > 90
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High memory usage on {{ $labels.instance }}"
          description: "Memory usage has exceeded 90% for 5 minutes on {{ $labels.instance }}"
```

3. **Create the rules files and apply the changes:**
   
   - Create a file at `/etc/prometheus/rules/memory_rules.yml` using your text editor.
   - Copy the recording rule YAML into this file and save it.
   
   - Create another file at `/etc/prometheus/rules/memory_alerts.yml`.
   - Copy the alert rule YAML into this file and save it.
   
   ```
   # Reload Prometheus configuration
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload
   ```
   
   4. **Verify your rules are working:**
   
   ```
   # Check in Prometheus UI that your new metric exists
   instance:node_memory_usage:percent
   ```
   
   If everything is set up correctly, you should see data for this metric.

> **Benefits of using recording rules:**
> - **Performance**: Queries using recording rules execute faster since the computation is done ahead of time
> - **Consistency**: Using the same named metrics ensures consistent results across dashboards
> - **Readability**: Complex expressions are replaced with descriptive metric names
> - **Efficiency**: Reduces the load on Prometheus for frequently used or complex queries
> - **Maintainability**: Easier to update queries in one place when stored as recording rules
