# ðŸ”— Lab 10: Join Queries & Vector Matching

## Objectives
- Master PromQL join operations and vector matching
- Learn different types of joins: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one
- Practice using `on()`, `ignoring()`, `group_left`, and `group_right`
- Build complex queries that combine multiple metric families
- Understand performance implications of different join strategies

## Instructions

### Part 1: Basic Vector Matching

1. **One-to-one matching with `on()`:**
   ```promql
   # Compare load average to CPU core count
   node_load1{instance="localhost:9100"} / on(instance) count by(instance) (node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode="idle"})
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** This query performs a one-to-one join on the `instance` label. It divides the 1-minute load average by the number of CPU cores for each instance. The `on(instance)` clause ensures that only metrics with matching instance labels are operated on together.

2. **One-to-one matching with `ignoring()`:**
   ```promql
   # Memory usage ratio ignoring device differences
   node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} / ignoring(job) node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"}
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** The `ignoring()` clause tells PromQL to ignore specific labels when matching vectors. This is useful when you want to join metrics that have additional labels that don't need to match exactly.

### Part 2: Many-to-One Joins with group_left

3. **Join network metrics with system memory using `group_left`:**
   ```promql
   # Network bandwidth per GB of system memory
   rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total{instance="localhost:9100",device!~"lo|veth.*"}[5m]) / on(instance) group_left(device) (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} / 1024^3)
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** `group_left(device)` allows a many-to-one join where the left side (network interfaces) can have multiple entries per instance, while the right side provides the system memory context. The `device` label is preserved from the left side. This shows network throughput efficiency relative to available memory resources.

4. **CPU usage per core with system metadata:**
   ```promql
   # CPU usage per core with total memory context
   rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode!="idle"}[5m]) / on(instance) group_left(cpu) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode!="idle"}[5m]) + rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode="idle"}[5m]))
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** This calculates CPU utilization per core while preserving the CPU core identifier using `group_left(cpu)`. This pattern is useful when you want to maintain granular labels while performing aggregations.

### Part 3: One-to-Many Joins with group_right

5. **System memory total with per-filesystem context using `group_right`:**
   ```promql
   # Total system memory with root filesystem context
   node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} / on(instance) group_right(mountpoint,fstype) node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance="localhost:9100",mountpoint="/"}
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** `group_right(mountpoint,fstype)` performs a one-to-many join where one memory total value is matched with filesystem entries, preserving the filesystem-specific labels from the right side. We filter to the root filesystem (`mountpoint="/"`) to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

### Part 4: Complex Multi-Metric Joins

6. **CPU and memory efficiency ratio:**
   ```promql
   # System efficiency: CPU load vs available resources
   (node_load1{instance="localhost:9100"} / on(instance) count by(instance) (node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode="idle"})) / on(instance) (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"})
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** This complex query combines CPU load efficiency (load per core) with memory availability to create an overall system efficiency metric. High values indicate the system is under load relative to available resources.

7. **Network throughput per CPU core:**
   ```promql
   # Network throughput efficiency per CPU core
   sum by(instance) (rate(node_network_transmit_bytes_total{instance="localhost:9100",device!="lo"}[5m])) / on(instance) count by(instance) (node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode="idle"})
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** This query calculates network throughput per CPU core by joining aggregated network metrics with CPU core counts. This can help identify whether network performance is CPU-bound.

### Part 5: Advanced Join Patterns

8. **Filesystem capacity planning with memory context:**
   ```promql
   # Available filesystem space as percentage of total system memory
   (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance="localhost:9100",mountpoint="/"} / on(instance) node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"}) * 100
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** This interesting join compares available disk space to total system memory, which can be useful for capacity planning in containerized environments where filesystem and memory constraints interact.

9. **Boolean join for system health check:**
   ```promql
   # Systems with both high load AND low memory
   (node_load1{instance="localhost:9100"} > on(instance) count by(instance) (node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode="idle"})) and on(instance) ((node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"}) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} > 0.8)
   ```
   
   > **Explanation:** This boolean join identifies instances where load exceeds CPU count AND memory usage is above 80%. Using `and on(instance)` ensures both conditions must be true for the same instance.

### Part 6: Performance Considerations

10. **Efficient aggregation before join:**
    ```promql
    # Better: Aggregate first, then join
    avg by(instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode!="idle"}[5m])) / on(instance) (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"})
    ```
    
    > **Explanation:** When possible, aggregate metrics before joining to reduce the number of time series that need to be matched. This query aggregates CPU usage across all cores before joining with memory metrics, which is more efficient than joining raw CPU metrics.

## Challenge: Multi-Service Resource Correlation

Can you write a query that joins CPU usage, memory usage, and network throughput to identify the most resource-efficient instances? Your query should:
- Calculate CPU usage percentage
- Calculate memory usage percentage  
- Include network throughput (bytes/sec)
- Combine all three metrics for instances with the same labels
- Return a score where lower numbers indicate better efficiency

<details>
<summary>ðŸ§ª <b>Show Solution</b></summary>

```promql
# Multi-metric efficiency score (lower is better)
(
  # CPU usage %
  (100 * (1 - avg by(instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode="idle"}[5m])))) 
  + 
  # Memory usage %
  (100 * (1 - (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"})))
  +
  # Network throughput (normalized to MB/s)
  (sum by(instance) (rate(node_network_transmit_bytes_total{instance="localhost:9100",device!="lo"}[5m])) / 1024 / 1024)
) / on(instance) 
# Normalize by system capacity
(
  count by(instance) (node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="localhost:9100",mode="idle"}) +
  (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} / 1024 / 1024 / 1024)
)
```

> **Explanation:** This advanced query:
> 1. Combines CPU %, memory %, and network throughput (MB/s) as a resource consumption score
> 2. Uses `on(instance)` joins to ensure all metrics are for the same instance
> 3. Normalizes the result by system capacity (CPU cores + memory in GB)
> 4. Lower scores indicate more efficient resource usage
> 5. Demonstrates how complex business logic can be built using PromQL joins

**Alternative approach - Simpler efficiency ratio:**
```promql
# Simple efficiency: load per available memory GB
node_load1{instance="localhost:9100"} / on(instance) (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{instance="localhost:9100"} / 1024 / 1024 / 1024)
```

## Best Practices for PromQL Joins

1. **Always specify matching strategy**: Use `on()` or `ignoring()` explicitly
2. **Aggregate before joining**: Reduce cardinality when possible
3. **Use group_left/group_right sparingly**: They can be expensive operations
4. **Match on stable labels**: Avoid joining on volatile labels like timestamps
5. **Test query performance**: Complex joins can impact query time
6. **Consider recording rules**: Pre-compute expensive joins for dashboards
